nano
========
Lightweight http parser implementation. nanohttp is a fork from mensley's tinyhttp but it has a working example, a Makefile and the source code minified withing two files.

dependencies:

* `<ctype.h> - tolower`
* `<string.h> - memcpy`
* `<string.h> - strncmp`

Honestly, this can be improved. If I need to, I'll be performing house keeping.


Compiling
---------
$ make

$ ./example
